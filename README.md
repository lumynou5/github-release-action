# Lumynous GitHub Release Action
This action creates GitHub releases automatically.

## Usage

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Release
        # Use the latest version.
        uses: lumynou5/github-release-action@main
        with:
          token: ${{github.token}}
```

In this example workflow, it'll create a release whenever push to `main` branch.
The version will be set according to the changelog following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Specifically, a release is created and the tag of the corresponding major version is moved onto that version.
If there isn't a tag of the major version, it'll be created.
